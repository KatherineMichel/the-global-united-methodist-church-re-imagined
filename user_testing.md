## User Recruiting Process

## Recruiting Screener Worksheet

I filled out the Google Ventures [Recruiting Screener Worksheet](http://www.gv.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Google-Ventures-Research-Sprint-Screener-Worksheet.pdf) to prepare for user recruitment

## Recruiting Screener Ad
Google Ventures often uses a [Craig's List ad](http://www.gv.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Google-Ventures-Research-Sprint-Sample-Craigslist-ad.png) to recruit users. Because members of the United Methodist Church would be the primary users, I sent an email ad to members of the congregation with a link to the [Recruiting Screener](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/16BgZQXq5FDxPuzamTADUWCKCPkizIKzR7now_lNrozM/viewform?usp=send_form).

## Recruiting Screener
I used [Google Forms](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/87809?hl=en) to create the [Recruiting Screener](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/16BgZQXq5FDxPuzamTADUWCKCPkizIKzR7now_lNrozM/viewform?usp=send_form). The results were automatically collected in a spreadsheet in Google Drive.

## Contacting Prospective Users

### Phone Call
After reviewing the Recruiter Screener responses automatically collected in a spreadsheet in Google Drive, I chose prospective user testing participants and called each one to confirm participation. 

### Confirmation Email

After the phone calls, I sent each confirmed participant a confirmation email. In each email I included:

* Date
* Time
* Directions
* Contact info
* NDA (if needed)
* A request that prospective users reply to confirm

Example Confirmation Email

Though Google Ventures suggests including in the email a link to a non-disclosure agreement ([Google Ventures Example Non-Disclosure Agreement](http://www.gv.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Google-Ventures-Research-Sprint-Sample-NDA.pdf)), I did not feel that one was needed for this situation.

The user testing interviews would be done using the [Prototype](prototype.md) that was the end result of my Design Sprint. 

### Testing Setup

* Removed extraneous files from computer destop 
* Moved prototype file to desktop
* Did a test run of prototype
* Opened lightning demo and mobile app use case links in a browser
* Printed interview guide and placed in clipboard alongside notepad and pen

### Interview Guide 

I used Google Ventures ["User Research, Quick 'n' Dirty,"](http://www.gv.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/User-Research-Workshop_Google-Ventures_Feb2013.pdf) as an interview planning resource.

#### Example Mobile App Use Case

As part of the interviews, I would use a hypothetical scenario that would involve the church where the interviews were taking place (Pretty Prairie United Methodist Church) and one of Pretty Prairie United Methodist Church's mission projects: Dora North Circuit in Mutare District of Zimbabwe.
