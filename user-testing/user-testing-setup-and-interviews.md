The user testing interviews would be done using the [Prototype](prototype.md) that was the end result of my Design Sprint.

I used Google Ventures ["User Research, Quick 'n' Dirty,"](https://www.dropbox.com/s/6kef5x79ap8f9v7/User-Research-Workshop_Google-Ventures_Feb2013.pdf) as an interview planning resource.
