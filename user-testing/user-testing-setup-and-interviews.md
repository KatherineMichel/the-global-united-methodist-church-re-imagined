The user testing interviews would be done using the Prototype that was the end result of my Design Sprint.

## Interview Guide 

I used Google Ventures ["User Research, Quick 'n' Dirty,"](https://www.dropbox.com/s/6kef5x79ap8f9v7/User-Research-Workshop_Google-Ventures_Feb2013.pdf) as an interview planning resource.

## Example Mobile App Use Case

As part of the interviews, I would use a hypothetical scenario that would involve the church where the interviews were taking place (Pretty Prairie United Methodist Church) and one of Pretty Prairie United Methodist Church's mission projects: Dora North Circuit in Mutare District of Zimbabwe.
