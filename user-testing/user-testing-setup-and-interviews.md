# User Testing Setup and Interviews

## Testing Setup

* Cleaned desk, computer, screen
* Removed extraneous files from computer destop 
* Moved prototype file to desktop
* Did a test run of prototype
* Opened lightning demo and mobile app use case links in a browser
* Printed interview guide and placed in clipboard alongside notepad and pen
* Cleaned room
* Placed a "Do not disturb! User testing in progress" sign on the door
* After each interview, reset testing setup, including prototype

The user testing interviews would be done using the Prototype that was the end result of my Design Sprint.

## Interview Guide 

I used Google Ventures ["User Research, Quick 'n' Dirty,"](https://www.dropbox.com/s/6kef5x79ap8f9v7/User-Research-Workshop_Google-Ventures_Feb2013.pdf) as an interview planning resource.

## Example Mobile App Use Case

As part of the interviews, I would use a hypothetical scenario that would involve the church where the interviews were taking place and one of its mission projects: Dora North Circuit in Mutare District of Zimbabwe.
