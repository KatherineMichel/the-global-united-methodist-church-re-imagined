| Some people have very negative feelings about integrating new technology and religion. How do you feel about it? | Says people have negative thoughts about anything new, but tech can be used effectively in combination with religion; But does not think people should worship alone; says people come to church for socializing/fellowship | Says tech can be used effectively as a tool for religion, but people who do not show up to worship are missing out on an essential part of the church experience that can't be replicated online (human emotion, socializing, sense of community, charitability toward neighbors); believes livestreaming, rebroadcasting are cause for worry except in special situations, though larger churches often do it; says churches are still being planted and drawing larger numbers of people, for instance in Africa, and church/live worship is an important rallying point; comments though that her ideas for community worship may not be survivable, adapatible due to people not showing up and operating expenses; comments that the brains of youth are being re-wired, tech often vital way to reach them | Thinks can be overused, for instance, says worship via tech cannot take place of feeling the spirit in person; does not think people should watch church on their phone | Says as tech advances, it allows us to do more things; if it can benefit worship, then it should be used; the church should change with the times; if that's the way that people communicate, that is also how they will become aware of what you are doing | Neutral |
