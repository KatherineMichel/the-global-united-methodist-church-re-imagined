### Storyboard
What I intended to be Crazy Eights become more like a Storyboard. I felt that after a critique, I could move on to a prototype.

#### Critique
* Moved settings page to be before find friends and connect social accounts
* Added a Bible study detail page
* Placed Bible verse "ephemeral message"/share after Bible study detail page due to logic of flow (highlighting passage to share)
* Added profile page to show what would look like with shared verse
* Added ephemeral message set up page
* Added Prayer Warriors availability page and moved live prayer after this
* Inserted groups search here
* Added bookmarked groups page, including groups context specific to the user testing participants
* Switched back to main menu instead of Bible study page
* Changed UMC Discover link to a context-specific one

### Prototype

These sketches formed the basis for a [Prototype](prototype.md) that I made.
