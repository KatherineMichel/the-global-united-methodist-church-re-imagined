## Summary of Results

"Software and mobile are eating the world" and a "global reorganization" is happening. The number of unconnected is shrinking as, between 2014 and 2020, "another billion people will come online" via smartphones, with "80% of the adults on earth" having a smartphone by 2020. This includes people in "places where it's hard to get electricity or water" and for whom the smartphone will be their first computer, and the only computer they can afford, but powerful enough to give them access to vast online resources. Communities of people, no matter their geographical proximity, are reorganizing in the cloud.

Worldwide (predominantly U.S.) interest in the search phrase ["United Methodist Church"](http://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=United%20Methodist%20Church) as well as ["Catholic" "Presbyterian" "Baptist"](http://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=United%20Methodist%2C%20Catholic%2C%20Presbyterian%2C%20Baptist&cmpt=q&tz=) (other mainline churches) has been steadily declining.

Meanwhile, worldwide interest in the search phrases ["LifeChurch" and "The Bible App"](http://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=LifeChurch%2C%20The%20Bible%20App) has been on the rise. 

This correlates with the rise in popularity of search phrases related to smartphone use and apps (starting with the revolutionary introduction of the iPhone in 2007), and decline in popularity of search phrase related to desktop and website (["iPhone" "app" "Android" "desktop" "website"](http://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=iPhone%2C%20app%2C%20Android%2C%20desktop%2C%20website&cmpt=q&tz=)), and rise in popularity of search phrases related to smartphone use, apps, and livestreaming for church (["church iPhone" "church app" "church Android" "church desktop" "church website"](http://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=church%20iPhone%2C%20church%20app%2C%20church%20Android%2C%20church%20livestream&cmpt=q&tz=)). 

Though search volume for the search phrase "United Methodist Church" is still far greater than that for "LifeChurch" and "The Bible App" (Google Trends graph for phrases ["United Methodist Church" "LifeChurch" "The Bible App"](http://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=United%20Methodist%20Church%2C%20LifeChurch%2C%20The%20Bible%20App))...
