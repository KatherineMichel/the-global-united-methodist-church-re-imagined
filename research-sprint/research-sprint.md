### Software and Mobile Eating the World, Global Reorganization 

"Software and mobile are eating the world" and a "global reorganization" is happening. The number of unconnected is shrinking as, between 2014 and 2020, "another billion people will come online" via smartphones, with "80% of the adults on earth" having a smartphone by 2020. This includes people in "places where it's hard to get electricity or water" and for whom the smartphone will be their first computer, and the only computer they can afford, but powerful enough to give them access to vast online resources. Communities of people, no matter their geographical proximity, are reorganizing in the cloud.

### Declining Interest in Traditional Mainstream Church and Rising Interest in Mobile Church

Worldwide (predominantly U.S.) interest in the search phrase ["United Methodist Church"](http://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=United%20Methodist%20Church) as well as ["Catholic" "Presbyterian" "Baptist"](http://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=United%20Methodist%2C%20Catholic%2C%20Presbyterian%2C%20Baptist&cmpt=q&tz=) (other mainline churches) has been steadily declining.

Meanwhile, worldwide interest in the search phrases ["LifeChurch" and "The Bible App"](http://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=LifeChurch%2C%20The%20Bible%20App) has been on the rise. 

This correlates with the rise in popularity of search phrases related to smartphone use and apps (starting with the revolutionary introduction of the iPhone in 2007), and decline in popularity of search phrase related to desktop and website (["iPhone" "app" "Android" "desktop" "website"](http://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=iPhone%2C%20app%2C%20Android%2C%20desktop%2C%20website&cmpt=q&tz=)), and rise in popularity of search phrases related to smartphone use, apps, and livestreaming for church (["church iPhone" "church app" "church Android" "church desktop" "church website"](http://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=church%20iPhone%2C%20church%20app%2C%20church%20Android%2C%20church%20livestream&cmpt=q&tz=)). 

### Reinvention to Avoid Disruption

Though search volume for the search phrase "United Methodist Church" is still far greater than that for "LifeChurch" and "The Bible App" (Google Trends graph for phrases ["United Methodist Church" "LifeChurch" "The Bible App"](http://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=United%20Methodist%20Church%2C%20LifeChurch%2C%20The%20Bible%20App)), this is the sort of David and Goliath story warned of in [Why Software Is Eating The World](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424053111903480904576512250915629460.html) by [Marc Andreessen](https://twitter.com/pmarca). 

Even industries with previously no connection at all to software (such as churches) are being "eaten by software," as more services are being delivered (and expected to be delivered) online. It has become easier (and cheaper) than ever for a small team of people (such as the LifeChurch founders) to leverage software to create a global, online organization that threatens to disrupt a slower-moving, large-scale, established incumbent organization (such as the United Methodist Church). The story of LifeChurch and its Bible App is very similar to that of any other technology startup, involving people with previous web development and entrepreneurial experience (literally) getting started by working out of a garage. 
The United Methodist Church, still one of the largest and most powerful denominations in the world is far from fully capitalizing on the opportunity to create a network effect using its pre-existing membership base and potential ecumenical users. The United Methodist Church is also failing to streamline its online offerings, and currently does not have any mobile app, missing the opportunity to fully capitalize on the shift to smartphones, including mobile-only developing countries where new membership in the United Methodist Church tends to be skyrocketting (unlike in the U.S. and other developed parts of the world, where membership is declining). 

Meanwhile, LifeChurch's Bible App is one of the most popular apps in both the Apple Store and Google Play store, enabling LifeChurch to fully leverage network effect based on power law. As the Bible App becomes more popular, it rises higher and higher in the app store rankings and is discovered by more people, only making it more popular. The mobile app takes advantage of the shift to smartphones, including in developing countries. The Bible App is commonly found through Google search results because of its straightforward name. And the app leads users to LifeChurch's website and livestream. Though fewer people attending church threatens income from tithing to the offering plate, LifeChurch has an untraditional business model.
