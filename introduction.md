# Introduction

## Research and Design Sprint

In the process of [Project Managing a Church Website, Marketing Materials, and Marketing Plan on a Budget](http://katherinemichel.gitbooks.io/church-website-and-marketing-on-a-budget/content/), I learned about problems (and opportunities) facing the global [United Methodist Church](http://www.umc.org). I project managed a Research and Design Sprint loosely based on the Google Ventures [Research Sprint](http://www.gv.com/lib/the-gv-research-sprint-a-4-day-process-for-answering-important-startup-questions) and [Design Sprint](http://www.gv.com/sprint) models. The goal was to re-imagine the global United Methodist Church, in line with trends in tech and United Methodist membership.

## Purpose
The purpose of the Research and Design Sprint is to design and user test a minimal, but realistic prototype (that potentially solves a problem) without the time and expense of creating a full version.

The process can also be a lot of fun :)
